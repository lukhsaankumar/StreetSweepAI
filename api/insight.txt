Over the past four weeks, the highest concentration of litter-related tickets has consistently occurred along the east–west alleyways between Main Street and King Street, particularly near the commercial loading zones. This pattern suggests that waste is accumulating around businesses during delivery hours and not being fully collected by the end of the day.

Weekends, especially Saturday evenings, show a notable spike in high-severity tickets near multi-unit residential buildings, indicating that shared waste rooms and outdoor bins are routinely overflowing before the next scheduled pickup. In contrast, lower‑density residential streets show mostly low- to medium-severity tickets, implying occasional litter rather than systemic collection issues.

To reduce overall waste severity, collection routes should prioritize the Main–King commercial alleys for earlier and possibly more frequent pickup, especially on weekday mornings. For multi-unit buildings, the municipality could pilot additional Saturday pickups during peak seasons, combined with clearer signage on recycling and garbage sorting in shared bin areas. Finally, targeted education campaigns for businesses on secure bin storage and for residents on proper use of communal bins could further reduce repeat high‑severity hotspots.
